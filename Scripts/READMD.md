This folder is for containnig small scripts that can help with the automation
of the simulator. It is not meant for post processing as those scrips should be
used in PythonTools.

Scripts here should aid the user in setting the simulation or for moving the data
to convinient locations. They should be relatively small, aiming for about 300
lines max. If they become lengthy then they should call other functions from
PythonTools.
