# Initial Angular Proeprties
[AngularProperties]

# This is based around how the earth spins around its z axis. Hence, the
# angular velocity can be said to be omegaVector = omegaMag * x_ECI
#
# omegaMag = 2*pi / TimePeriod_s
#
# The time period of earths spin is 23 hours, 56 minutes and 3.45 seconds, or
# 86163.45 seconds.

# From taking the ECI frame is defined as being rotated 23.4 degrees around
# the x axis of the Sun Centric frame, which is a quaternion of:
#
#       quaternion_FixToInertCen[0] = 0.2027872954
#       quaternion_FixToInertCen[1] = 0.0
#       quaternion_FixToInertCen[2] = 0.0

#
# [ref: https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/Tutorials/pdf/individual_docs/17_frames_and_coordinate_systems.pdf]
#
# Hence, using this the z axis of the InertCen frame can be found by rotating the
# vector [0, 0, 1]. This results in:
#
#       zECI_Fix[0] = 0.0
#       zECI_Fix[1] = -0.3971478906
#       zECI_Fix[2] = 0.9177546257
#
# This can be treated as the unit vector of the angular velocity.
#
# The quaternion which rotates the body from the Inertial Centric frame to the
# Geo-Central frame can be described as a rotation around the z axis by angle:
#
#       rotatedAngle_rad = omegaMag * (simTime_s - J2000Time_s)
#
# The reason it is time after J2000 is because that is whe the ECI frame was
# defined. With this the quaternion to rotate from ECI to ECEF frame can be
# defined as below:
#
#       quaternion_InertCenToGeoCen[0] = 0.0
#       quaternion_InertCenToGeoCen[1] = 0.0
#       quaternion_InertCenToGeoCen[2] = sin(rotatedAngle_rad / 2)
#       quaternion_InertCenToGeoCen[3] = cos(rotatedAngle_rad / 2)
#
# With this, the following quaternion from the fixed frame to earth body can be
# found:
#
#       quaternion_FixToBody = quaternion_InertCenToGeoCen * quaternion_FixToInertCen
#
# It should be noted that this doesn't take into consideration how earth's
# rotation shifts slightly, but it serves as a good baseline for simulation
# purposes.
