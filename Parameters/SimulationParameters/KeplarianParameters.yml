# This yaml file contains the keplarian parameters between the bodies for the
# simulation.
#
# Note: This file needs to be in the same folder as the .ini files which contain
#       the parameters of the bodies so that the files can be accessed.

# Parameter containing the number of bodies within the simulation
nBodies : 3

# Parameters to indiacte the order with which the bodies should follow.
#
# Note:   The bodies are in this order because the avilable data of the Earth is
#         given with respect to Sun, and JamSail will have its elements given
#         respect to the Earth.
body0 : Sun
body1: Earth
body2: JamSail

# Argument to define how the positions of the other bodies should be defined to
mainBody: body0

# Keplarian elements of body 2 with relation to body 1
# [Ref: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.htmlf]
#
# Note: timeSincePeriapsis_s was found from taking the mean longitude and using
#       the equation: 
#
#                     timeSincePeriapsis_s = t_j2000 - T/2*PI
#                                   *(meanLongitude_rad - argumentOfPerigee_rad)
#     
#       Where t_j2000 is the unix time of January 1st 2000 at 12 noon. The time
#       of timeSincePeriapsis_s is given in unix time.
